# Medical Diagnosis System
An end-to-end medical diagnostic web application powered by Machine Learning, Django, and ReactJS.Built with a scalable Django REST API backend and a modern ReactJS frontend. The system enables doctors and patients to upload medical data (X-ray images, retinal scans, and clinical parameters) to get predictions for:
- Pneumonia Detection (CNN model on chest X-rays)
- Diabetic Retinopathy Detection (CNN model on retinal images)
- Heart Disease Prediction (ML model on patient health data)
